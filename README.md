# Note to reader
 This particular directory is based off an activity I worked on in December of 2023 from Modules 28, specifically 28.13, in the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN." This upload is my best attempt at creating starter files for the restaurant app we are working on in 28.13. 
 
 This is meant to preserve a moment in time / a point in the development of the app. It is also meant to share with other future students who will struggle at this point as I did. I hope to save others the time I spent in trying to "invent" the code.
 
 Unfortuanately, Professor Williams dives into a project half built, without showing or providing the code. I did my best to copy the code by stopping the video at certain points, but not all the code was displayed. In some cases I inserted code from a starter file. This is my best guess at what code one should have when doing 28.13. 
 
 Unfortunately I know it is wrong because at about 7:11 in the video, he shows that he has two folders called backup and backup2; I have neither, nor can I determine what is in those folders. He navigates to backup and types a terminal command: npm run start. He then tests the app to make sure it is working. I could not do this.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
